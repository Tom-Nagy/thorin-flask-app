    The formation of the group grew out of a meeting Gandalf had with Thorin in Bree which kindled Thorin's interest
    in recapturing his long lost family inheritance. (Thorin's grandfather had been the king of the Lonely Mountain
    when Smaug came and took it.) Remembering that he had once known an adventurous Hobbit on his travels in the
    Shire, Gandalf decided to add Bilbo to their company because he knew that stealth and cunning were preferable to
    force. Gandalf also believed that someone like Bilbo could keep the sometimes prideful and stubborn Dwarves from
    rash action. The superstitious Dwarves also considered thirteen to be an unlucky number, and as Gandalf had
    planned to leave on other business, welcomed a fourteenth to fill into their party.

        <h3>Thorin Oakenshield</h3>
        <p>
            In the year TA 2746, Thorin II was born to Dwarven prince Thráin II in the mountain city of The Lonely
            Mountain. Early in his youth, he and the other Dwarves of the Lonely Mountain were forced to flee by the
            dragon Smaug in TA 2770. While in exile, he quickly grew to become a capable warrior. This was demonstrated
            when he participated in the Battle of Azanulbizar in TA 2799. He marched with one of the Dwarven armies
            beneath the East-gate of Moria. At some point in the fighting, his shield broke, and using an oaken tree
            branch found on the floor as a shield, he gained the epithet "Oakenshield," which would remain with him even
            in death.

        <h3>Fili and Kili</h3>
        <p>
            Fíli and Kíli were nephews of Thorin, who was the elder brother of their mother Dís. They were also nephews
            of Frerin, grandsons of Thráin II, and great-grandsons of Thrór. Fíli's most distinguishing feature was his
            long nose, the longest of any of the Dwarves in Thorin's company.

            As the youngest Dwarves, Fíli and Kíli had the sharpest eyes, and were often sent scouting or searching. It
            was they that found the Front Porch while in the Misty Mountains.

            <h3>Oin</h3>
            <p>
                Óin was the older brother of Glóin, cousin of Dwalin and Balin, and uncle of Gimli. Oin's uncle was King
                Fundin, the father of Balin and Dwalin. He usually wore a brown-hooded cloak when travelling. Óin fought
                in the Battle of Azanulbizar along with Thorin Oakenshield, and in TA 2941 joined with Thorin and
                Company on the quest to reclaim the Lonely Mountain wearing a brown hood.[2] Óin was one of the Dwarves
                who bet that Bilbo would come along with them to reclaim the Lonely Mountain. Óin and his brother Glóin
                were usually in charge of preparing the fire for the Company as they were the most skilled out of the
                others. He fought in and survived the Battle of the Five Armies, and later settled in the Lonely
                Mountain with King Dain Ironfoot II along with many other dwarves of The Company of Thorin.

                Fellowship of the Ring.

                Glóin chiefly appears in The Hobbit as a supporting character. Glóin also appears in The Fellowship of

                Balin was a Dwarf leader, the son of Fundin, and elder brother of Dwalin. He was one of the thirteen
                Dwarves who accompanied Thorin II Oakenshield on the quest to regain the Lonely Mountain.
                A Dwarf Lord known for his wise counsel and willingness to listen, he was one of Thorin's closest
                friends and advisers. Balin was distantly related to him, and a descendant of the noble house of Durin.

                He later went to re-establish the kingdom of Moria, but within five years it was overcome once more by
                Orcs, and he was killed there along with the rest of his companions.

                Lonely Mountain from the dragon Smaug.

                Dori was among the Dwarves at Bag End who joined in singing about "blunting the knives" and "bending the
                forks"; as well as accompanying by playing the flute. He was described as “decent fellow despite his
                grumbling”. He often wore a red-violet coat while on the Quest for Erebor. He was noted by Thorin to be
                the strongest of the thirteen companions.

                familial relations are unclear, and what is known of his parentage is very little. He and his family
                were driven out of their home in the Lonely Mountain by the Dragon Smaug, and were forced to live in
                exile, where the Dwarf warrior worked as a toy maker. Following Thorin II Oakenshield to a new life in
                the Blue Mountains, he continued his life as a toy maker.

                Bofur's heritage is unclear, but he was not of Durin's Folk. He and his family hailed from the Blue
                Mountains. As such, they felt less strongly about the quest to reclaim the Lonely Mountain from the
                dragon Smaug, more interested in the adventure than a home they'd never seen.

                Bombur's parentage is unknown. He is the brother of Bofur and cousin of Bifur. Bombur was not of Durin's
                line, although he was descended from the Dwarves of Moria. His birth date is unknown, though it fell
                somewhere between TA 2763 and TA 2859; the brothers Fíli and Kíli were the youngest of the thirteen "by
                some fifty years," and, after Thorin was captured, Balin was "the eldest left." Fíli was born in TA
                2859, and Balin was born in TA 2763. Bombur was thus roughly 150 years old during the quest. Prior to
                the journey, Bombur likely resided in the Blue Mountains alongside Thorin, after the loss of Thráin II.
